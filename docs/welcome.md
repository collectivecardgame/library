Welcome to the Library! This section of the site has all the official rules for the Democratic Process of Collective.

For a quick intro to the rules, we made a low-budget video you should watch first:

The Library should be considered the most up-to-date place to find the current rules for creating, updating and voting in Collective (AKA the "Democratic Process.")

We also have a [GitHub](https://github.com/collectivecardgame/library), which makes it easy to suggest changes to the Library. If we are missing something or if you'd like to add something to an FAQ section (for example), you can suggest changes here!

## [Wiki](https://collective.gamepedia.com/Collective_Wiki)

Our [Wiki](https://collective.gamepedia.com/Collective_Wiki) is moderated heavily by the players. It's a great addition for learning more about our Collective's in-game lore as well as history of the game itself. If you'd like to help expand on a topic or two, or just want to have a good read, you can check it out!
