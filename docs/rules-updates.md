a card is desired to be changed in any manner, one can submit an [Update] or [Cosmetic Update] to the [Subreddit](https://old.reddit.com/r/collectivecg/) with a modified version of the card. Alternatively, you can post the card as a Balance Team post and let the balance team decide an [Update] for it instead.
The top 5 voted Standard Updates, the top 5 Legacy Updates and any Balance Team posts with a greater or equal amount of votes than the 10th normal submission each week are accepted, while any amount of Cosmetic Updates are accepted under the same condition as other updates.

## Rules for Updating Cards

You can update anything about a card, including its cost, what it does, its art, etc.
The purpose of an [Update] is to rebalance a card, not replace it. We believe that no card has "inherently problematic design," and all can be rebalanced without completely redesigning it. Updates are necessary for the game's health, but should never be mean-spirited. 
An update is to be tagged as [Standard Update] or [Legacy Update] depending on whether the card is in current rotation or not. [Cosmetic Update] and [Balance Team] each follow a different ruling as detailed below.

### 1. No 'ground up' redesigns

The definition of a "ground up redesign" is ambiguous, and hard to define, but if you change the original idea of the card too much, we may not allow your submission. Notably, this isn’t limited to only a card’s functionality; massively changing a card’s art, flavour, tribes, etc can also get the update removed for being a complete redesign. Following the same logic, a card’s creators cannot be changed at all.
As a rule of thumb, if you cannot recognise the update as being the original card in functionality or otherwise, chances are it is going too far and may be removed.
One notable exception is changing a DC card in a way that it would no longer qualify for the DC conditions, which is allowed so long as the update is still not a redesign.

### 2. You cannot remove a card

You cannot change a card which had a non-Token rarity to be of Token rarity (effectively removing it from the collection). This is an occasional desire from players unhappy with a card due to being wildly unbalanced or otherwise devoid either player from having fun. It however is part of the game’s philosophy that once a card has been accepted into the game, it will never leave the game.

### 3. Cards can be updated on the same week they were submitted in

[Standard Update]s or [Cosmetic Update]s to cards which have not been added to the game yet are allowed; if the [Card] post gets in and the [Standard Update] or [Cosmetic Update] does too, it will be updated before it is added to the game.

### 4. Core Set cards can’t be updated

With Core Set referring to any cards that have “Collective Design Team” as their creator.

Unlike other cards, these are hardcoded into the game, which makes any attempt to change them in any manner particularly difficult.



## Cosmetic Updates

Not all updates aim to change the functionality or balance of a card, some may just change its tribes or add flavour text. These are tagged as [Cosmetic Update] regardless of its status in rotation and do not compete for limited slots, there are however several restrictions to what qualifies as a cosmetic update

- A cosmetic update can only change a card’s name, tribes, flavour text, art (this one allowing for one to change the card’s artist name) or add/change the code of a card in a manner that doesn’t change how the card works gameplay-wise (eg, adding emotes or animations).
- Name, tribes and art are mutually exclusive to reduce the likelihood of a cosmetic update qualifying as a redesign as detailed on rule 1.
- While some of this may sometimes have a gameplay impact (specially tribes), it has been decided that their impact is minor enough to be considered as “cosmetic”.



## Balance Team

Sometimes the community agrees that something needs to change, but not on how it should be changed, in these cases one may decide to post a [Balance Team] and let a small group of non-specified players supervised by the Committee's balance team decide how to change it.

- A [Balance Team] post must consist of the card’s name, a brief explanation in the title, and the card’s link.
- Said explanation must be clear on whether the card should be nerfed, buffed or sidegraded and provide some context behind the wish for a change.
- Unlike anything else in the weekly, Balance Team updates are listed in the week they get in, but are implemented on the week after, giving the team a full week to decide on a change.
- The balance team still has to follow the same rules as normal updates.

### Note: Conflicting Updates

- If two [Update] or [Cosmetic Update] or a combination for the same card are voted into the top 10 and have "conflicting changes," we will only use whichever one has more upvotes.
- Conflicting change examples would include: any two [Update] posts, an [Update] and a [Balance Team] post, or two [Cosmetic Update] posts which change the same aspect of a card (its name, for example).
- If a [Cosmetic Update] and a [Balance Team] for the same card are voted into the top 10, the Cosmetic Update will be used as the basis of the [Balance Team] post.
